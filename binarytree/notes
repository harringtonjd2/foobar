1.  Given list of nodes, and height of tree, find the parents of the nodes

2.  Root of tree is 2**h - 1 (also the number of nodes)

3.  Left children are 2**(d+1) where d is the depth of the child

4.  Right children are 1 more than the parent

5.  To find the height of the child with label n, used recursive formula
